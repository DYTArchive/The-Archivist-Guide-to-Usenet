# Providers

If you want access to Usenet, you must first sign up to a provider. The deals you can get can be pretty good. It's either a monthly or yearly subscription. These providers will always give you a better deal on holidays and on their yearly plans.

The ones I recommend are the following:

- [Eweka](https://www.eweka.nl/en)
- [NewsgroupDirect](https://newsgroupdirect.com/)
- [Frugal Usenet](https://frugalusenet.com/)

Eweka is the most praised out of all of them. It does not allow cryptocurrency payments but you can always use a VISA gift card.

NewsgroupDirect and Frugal Usenet both accept cryptocurrency payments and let you upload as soon as you purchase their subscription. 

NewsgroupDirect allows 100 simultaneous connections and access to other providers, but is more expensive. 

Frugal Usenet is most viable on its yearly subscription that allows access to the full 5267 day retention rate. 

There are other providers, but they all have worse deals than what I have presented here.
