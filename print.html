<p>Welcome to <strong>The Archivist Guide to Usenet</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="your-journey-into-the-unknown"><a class="header" href="#your-journey-into-the-unknown">Your Journey Into The Unknown</a></h2>
<p>This guide will show you the process of creating an account on a provider, setting up software to download and upload, and using your new-found knowledge to archive your much-loved content.</p>
<h2 id="a-little-about-usenet"><a class="header" href="#a-little-about-usenet">A Little About Usenet</a></h2>
<p>Usenet is an underrated medium for archival. It has many potential uses within our community. It's unconventional, but once acquainted with it, it can serve its use surprisingly well, and it can even become a viable option for those that cannot afford the analogous physical or cloud storage. The main audience is pirates, and now the minority will be librarians!</p>
<p>11$ a month can get you 100 simultaneous connections with unlimited bandwidth. There are cheaper yearly plans that are only 3$ that offer 50 connections, but that will do just fine for most people. To really make use of all of those 100 connections you would need a 10Gbps internet connection.</p>
<p>I also have to mention that there are no storage quotas. You just upload, and they store, maybe. You don't have your own little private space and a limited amount. Everything you upload is immediately public and synced across multiple datacenters with their own rules, speeds, hardware, and country-specific laws. It's not a good idea to (accidentally) upload your private files on Usenet, so be careful. And have fun trying to get it removed. Great for being censorship-resistant, bad for mishaps. Content is stored on the servers anywhere between 1 and over 5000 days. Although the typical amount of days is between 2000 and 5000. There are still many files uploaded 14 years ago you can download today.</p>
<p>Technically, you have unlimited storage. Realistically, if you keep uploading TB of junk you'll get your account banned by the provider you use, and if your abuse is significant, it will make providers increase their subscription prices and restrict upload access, so don't ruin it for the rest of us.</p>
<h2 id="technicalities"><a class="header" href="#technicalities">Technicalities</a></h2>
<p>Usenet is the OG forum. Just like how content is served over HTTP, news (user-made, plain text posts that are similar to email) are served over NNTP, a fairly simple, robust, and extremely old protocol. These posts are submitted to groups such as <code>alt.binaries.multimedia</code>, <code>alt.binaries.documentaries</code>, <code>alt.linux</code> and many others. The standard format is <code>x</code>, <code>x.y</code>, <code>x.y.z</code>. The creations of new groups is up to the Higher Order of Usenet Wizards (they're actually called The Big-8 Management). You submit a request and they'll decide. But the creation of new groups is not something we need or want.</p>
<p>There isn't just one Usenet, but there is &quot;one&quot; agreed-upon Usenet synchronized over multiple datacenters. All of these Usenet providers have to store data like posts and groups on hardware, usually in datacenters. They have all agreed a long time ago to talk to each other and synchronize data between each other. It's purely a mutual agreement that can be broken due to DMCA violations, illegal content, or anything like that. But most of the time, if some content is not available on one provider, it will be available on some other or multiple others.</p>
<p>Someone went ahead and thought of adding binaries to Usenet. The only limitation is that articles posted on the network have a fixed size. The big idea was to just split the files across multiple articles, in plain text. It's not that inefficient and works fairly well. You then assemble those pieces into files. The way you give instructions on how to assemble those articles together is typically by adding them to a file called an NZB, an XML file that has links to the articles. Whatever Usenet downloader you use reads that file, downloads the articles, and then merges them into actual files.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="providers"><a class="header" href="#providers">Providers</a></h1>
<p>If you want access to Usenet, you must first sign up to a provider. The deals you can get can be pretty good. It's either a monthly or yearly subscription. These providers will always give you a better deal on holidays and on their yearly plans.</p>
<p>The ones I recommend are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.eweka.nl/en">Eweka</a></li>
<li><a href="https://newsgroupdirect.com/">NewsgroupDirect</a></li>
<li><a href="https://frugalusenet.com/">Frugal Usenet</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Eweka is the most praised out of all of them. It does not allow cryptocurrency payments but you can always use a VISA gift card.</p>
<p>NewsgroupDirect and Frugal Usenet both accept cryptocurrency payments and let you upload as soon as you purchase their subscription. </p>
<p>NewsgroupDirect allows 100 simultaneous connections and access to other providers, but is more expensive. </p>
<p>Frugal Usenet is most viable on its yearly subscription that allows access to the full 5267 day retention rate. </p>
<p>There are other providers, but they all have worse deals than what I have presented here.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="downloading"><a class="header" href="#downloading">Downloading</a></h1>
<p>The most commonly used and actively maintained &quot;Binary Newsreader&quot; (downloader) is <a href="https://sabnzbd.org/">SABnzbd</a>. Highly extensible and performant, it runs on a WebUI that you can access over the internet or on your local network.</p>
<p>SABnzbd already has its own guides on how to install and set it up. Here's the one for <a href="https://sabnzbd.org/wiki/installation/install-windows">Windows</a> and the one for <a href="https://sabnzbd.org/wiki/installation/install-unix">Linux</a>.</p>
<p>If you're running Linux as your desktop and want to run SABnzbd on your user account and have it start with your system, you should execute the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable --now sabnzbd@your username, this is a placeholder, replace it with your actual username
</code></pre>
<p>Once you've added the servers (providers) to SABnzbd, you can test out your speed by reading an NZB file. You can get one from <a href="https://nzbking.com/">NZBKing</a>. You will be surprised at the speeds you can achieve. The NZB file is plain text XML, and you should examine its format to gain a better understand of how it works.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="uploading"><a class="header" href="#uploading">Uploading</a></h1>
<p>To upload content to Usenet, you must use a provider that allows upload access. Fortunately, the providers I have listed in the <a href="./download.html">Downloading</a> section are fit for this role.</p>
<p>The software I recommend is <a href="https://github.com/animetosho/Nyuu">Nyuu</a>. It has <a href="https://github.com/animetosho/Nyuu/blob/master/bench/info.md#results">clear performance benefits</a> and is used by the anime uploading service called <a href="https://animetosho.org/">Anime Tosho</a>.</p>
<p>You can begin using it by modifying the <a href="https://github.com/animetosho/Nyuu/blob/master/config-sample.json">sample configuration file</a> with the login data your Usenet provider has given you. There are delimiters in the configuration file that are important to consider: &quot;<strong>Server Options</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Article Options</strong>&quot;. The <code>from</code> and <code>comment</code> are arbitrary and should not contain personal information. They are as public as the files|articles you are uploading. </p>
<p>The configuration file is read by using Nyuu as such: <code>nyuu -C config.json</code>. The options present in this file are the &quot;defaults&quot;. Instead of modifying the contents of the file when faced with an edge case, you can specify or override them on runtime using it's various command-line parameters that are found through the help command <code>nyuu --help</code>.</p>
<p>Remember to increase the number of connections to the one allowed by your provider (50 or 100 usually) to improve the upload speed significantly.</p>
<p>This is an example use of Nyuu reading from the configuration file, uploading all files from a directory recursively (through all the subdirectories and their children) to the group <code>alt.binaries.multimedia</code>, and outputting the articles to an NZB file:</p>
<pre><code>nyuu -C config.json -r -g alt.binaries.multimedia -o ./jawed.nzb ./youtube/jawed/ 
</code></pre>
